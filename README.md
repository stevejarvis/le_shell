Le Shell
========

Cloned from it's original location at [https://bitbucket.org/stevejarvis/le_shell](https://bitbucket.org/stevejarvis/le_shell).

It's a fairly usable shell. Most of the basic features are present and working, there's
also a few extras.

Usage
-----

Only requirement is the GNU Readline library. Then launch straight-away.

     $ ./leshell.pl
