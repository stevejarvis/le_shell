The name Le Shell means nothing really, just that I like to put "le" in front of words
ever since high school French.

It's a fairly usable shell. Most of the basic features are present and working, there's
also a few extras.

Should be very easy to run, it's only a single file, but requires the GNU Readline
library. After that's set up, just launch straight-away.
